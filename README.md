# NLPSolve

This project contains code from the tutorial [How to solve 90% of NLP problems: a step-by-step guide](https://blog.insightdatascience.com/how-to-solve-90-of-nlp-problems-a-step-by-step-guide-fda605278e4e).
The original data for the project can be downloaded [here](https://www.crowdflower.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/socialmedia-disaster-tweets-DFE.csv). This data is not formated
correctly and has line folding. The formated data for the project with only relevant columns can be found on their repo and downloaded [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hundredblocks/concrete_NLP_tutorial/master/socialmedia_relevant_cols.csv).

###### Note: The CSV file in the link is encoded with ISO-8859-1 encoding. So all reading methods should account for that.
